# Interaction Designer Portfolio

The goal is to create a personal website to showcase my projects. My aim is to use [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), an AI language model, to create the entire portfolio.
The website will have a homepage that will display four featured projects, a repository page containing all completed projects, and a blog page for news related to the interaction design industry. To build the website, I will use standard pages connected to a database created through [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). This will make it easy to insert my projects into the website.
The website's texts, images, and videos will be retrieved directly from a public Notion page. This will give me a simple CMS to use, and I can also use [NotionAI](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai) to write the texts for the projects and news. The project aims to test the limits of chatGPT and fully understand its functionalities.
By creating a personal website using chatGPT, I hope to showcase the power and capabilities of AI in web development. Moreover, I believe that this project will serve as a stress-test for chatGPT, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of the platform's limitations and possibilities.
